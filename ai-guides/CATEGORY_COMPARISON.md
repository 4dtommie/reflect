## Differences & Observations

### 1. **Subscriptions Approach** ✅
- **Our approach:** Subscriptions distributed across relevant categories (Entertainment, Software & Tools, Education, Healthcare)
- **Common apps:** Often have a standalone "Subscriptions" category
- **Our advantage:** More meaningful categorization by purpose
- **Verdict:** Our approach is better - subscriptions are a payment method, not an expense type

### 2. **Food Categories** ✅
- **Our approach:** Food & Groceries (with 4 subcategories) + Restaurants & Dining (with 5 subcategories)
- **Common apps:** Usually just "Groceries" and "Dining Out"
- **Our advantage:** More granular tracking (Supermarket, Butcher, Baker, Specialty Stores, Coffee, Lunch, etc.)
- **Verdict:** Our approach is more detailed and useful

### 3. **Insurance** ⚠️
- **Our approach:** Single "Insurance" category
- **Common apps:** Often have subcategories (Health, Auto, Life, Home, Pet)
- **Suggestion:** Consider adding subcategories for better tracking

### 4. **Housing** ⚠️
- **Our approach:** Single category with keywords for rent, mortgage, maintenance
- **Common apps:** Sometimes separate "Rent" and "Mortgage" or include property taxes
- **Suggestion:** Could add subcategories: Rent, Mortgage, Maintenance, Property Tax

### 5. **Transportation** ⚠️
- **Our approach:** Single category with keywords
- **Common apps:** Sometimes separate "Car Payment", "Gas", "Public Transit"
- **Suggestion:** Could add subcategories: Car Payment, Fuel, Public Transit, Parking, Maintenance

### 6. **Shopping** ⚠️
- **Our approach:** General retail purchases
- **Common apps:** Often separate "Clothing", "Electronics", "Home Goods"
- **Suggestion:** Could add subcategories or separate categories

## Dutch-Specific Considerations

Based on Dutch personal finance practices:

1. **Zorgverzekering** - Health insurance is mandatory, might deserve its own subcategory
2. **Hypotheek** - Mortgage is a major expense, could be separate from rent
3. **Belastingen** - Taxes (besides income tax refunds) might need a category
4. **Pensioen** - Retirement contributions (pensioen) are important
5. **Kinderopvang** - Childcare is significant (we have this in income as "kinderopvangtoeslag", but expenses too)
6. **OV** - Public transport is common (we have this in Transportation keywords)
