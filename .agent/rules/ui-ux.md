## UI/UX
- Use DaisyUI components (btn, card, modal, etc.)
- Follow existing design patterns
- Keep components focused and small (<200 lines)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility (proper labels, ARIA when needed)
- Use funny/quirky copy where possible
- Always use sentence case (only first word capitalized).
