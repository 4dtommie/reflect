## Planning & Discussion
- **ALWAYS discuss and plan first before implementing anything**
- Present the approach, get user approval, then implement
- Break down complex tasks into clear steps
- Explain trade-offs and alternatives when relevant

## When Editing
- Read existing code patterns first
- Match existing style and structure
- Update related files if needed
- Check for breaking changes
- Verify no linter errors remain
